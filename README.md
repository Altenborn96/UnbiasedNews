This app fetches news articles from the NewsAPI and lets you explore and organize them in different ways. You can favorite articles, filter them by category, and choose which categories the news ticker should display.

To use the app, youâ€™ll need your own API key from newsapi.org.
Once you have it, add the key to the apiKey field in the Newsapi file.
